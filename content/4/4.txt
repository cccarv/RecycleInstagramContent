Happy Friday! ðŸš€  Hello, how is it going? Today Wojtek and I are planning a lot of further steps on our agency (@selfmade.software ). We got our first projects and we will be focusing to deliver them and build a strong and long relationship with our first clients. I can't say how happy I am that things are finally starting to move ðŸ”¥. Every day is a new adventure. I love this journey so far. Stay healthy my friends and enjoy your weekend! Let me know what are you plans for tonight ðŸŒš  - Jakob from Self Made #peoplewhocode #macbook #entrepreneur #workhardanywhere #mobiledevelopment #codinglife #tech #developer #code #workandtravel #softwareengineer #programmerlife #ios #webdev #coder #css #dev #developerlife #webdeveloper #iosdeveloper #engineer #appdeveloper #webdevelopment #codingisfun #thedevlife #javascript #fullstackdeveloper #apple #worldcode #programmer
