Happy Thursday ‚òÄÔ∏è Hey, Hope you doing great! Just finished coding project for a client. Automation for Amazon MWS. Pulling a different kind of reports, parsing them and uploading into Google BigQuery. Honestly, this was my first time working with all of those things, however after spending a whole day of learning about those technologies I created project successfully. The last part is to deploy the code on the Google Cloud Functions and schedule it daily. Shouldn't be a problem üî• Hope our (@selfmade.software ) client will like it!  How was your day?
