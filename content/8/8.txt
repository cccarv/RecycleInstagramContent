You are not late 🔥 . Right now, today, in 2020 is the best time to start something on the internet. There has never been a better time in the whole history of the world to invent something. There has never been a better time with more opportunities, more openings, lower barriers, higher benefit/risk ratios, better returns, greater upside, than now. Right now, this minute. This is the time that folks in the future will look back at and say, “Oh to have been alive and well back then!” . Have a great Monday ✌️🔥 . . . #buildupdevs⁣ #hacking #softwareengineer #programminglife #dev #webdev #hacker #engineer #programmerslife #coders #developers #programmerlife #programmingmemes #website #angular #frontend #ai #machinelearning #artificialintelligence #devlife #worldcode
