Is software development really a dead-end job after 35-40? . Believe it or not, there are many very successful developers past the age of 40. Some of them are doing some of the best work of their careers. For example, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson are past the age of 60 and they created the Go programming language. They are very senior engineers at Google and I'm sure are quite well compensated for what they do. Also in the companies where I used to work there are really great senior developers who are older than 35 years and they just love what they do. It is all about passion. If you love what you do then you don't have to drop programming and go more into managing type of job. . What is your opinion about it? Is coding just for the youngster or also for older people?
